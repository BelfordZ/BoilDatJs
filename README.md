<h1>What does it do?</h1>
<p>I'm sick of writing boilerplate js and index.html, linking all the scripts etc. Further, I'm sick of having giant JS files, and prefer C-like 'file per class'. </p>
<p>There are lots of frameworks and various packages out there, and I use alot of similar things from project to project. However, I don't want to use things like Boilerplate or Bootstrap because I simply dont need all the bloat. Further, I want something that is very simple to customize. </p>
<p>This tool is a tiny little bash script that will grow to become what ever I want it to be.</p>

<h1>It's simple as it gets</h1>
<p>
Linux & OSX: (terminalate the following) 
<ul>
<li>'mkdir BoilDatJs'</li>
<li>'cd BoilDatJs'</li>
<li>'git clone git@github.com:BelfordZ/BoilDatJs.git'</li>
<li>'./install'</li>
</ul>
Windows: nope. <br>
There ya' go. Next time you are starting a new project make your directory and type:
<ul>
<li>'boiler' [any number of classes to make]</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1> Example Usage</h1>
<p>To start a project from your bp_index.html file and class template bp_class.js I could type the following: 
boiler myClass1 myClass2 myClass3 <br>
This will create an index.html, linked with myClass1, myClass2, etc.<br>
